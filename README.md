More Animations
=======

There are 2 Zoltars, 1 using javascript and 1 not. There is also a shell game using a little bit of JS and CSS. It's very alpha.

Zoltar eyes works on mouse hover so a lot of elements are tied to other elements.
The Zoltar fortune (JS version) includes the ability to create new fortunes using the Fortune object. This was built off of Zoltar eyes leaving lots of interconnected elements that could be disconnected.

[3/27/14]All make heavy use of keyframes for the animations and currently only work in Mozilla browsers as the browser prefixes haven't been added yet 

Bull
=======

The bull is CSS only, using absolute positioning and a lot of pixels
